### 1. General.
A. The software (including Boot ROM code and other embedded software), documentation, interfaces, content, fonts and any data that came with your Apple-branded hardware, as may be updated or replaced by software updates or system restore software provided by Apple (collectively, “Apple Software”) are licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Apple”) for use only under the terms of this License. Apple and its licensors retain ownership of the Apple Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. You agree that the terms of this License will apply to any Apple-branded application software that may be pre-installed on your Apple-branded hardware, unless such software is accompanied by a separate license. The term “Apple Software” as used herein includes any third-party software that is provided to you by Apple and that Apple is licensed to include in Apple Software.

B. Apple, at its discretion, may make available future upgrades or updates to the Apple Software for your Apple-branded computer. The Apple Software updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Apple releases for newer or other models of Apple-branded computers. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Apple that replace and/or supplement the original Apple Software product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.

### 2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install, use, and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at a time. For example, these single copies may be installed on a desktop computer and a laptop computer but may not be used on both computers at the same time.

B. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install, use, and run two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Apple-branded computer you own or control and that is already running the Apple Software. These copies or instances may only be used for development, testing, or distribution of your software products that run on the Apple Software. You may not use these additional copies or instances for other purposes.

C. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may allow other users of the Apple-branded computer on which you are running the Apple Software to use the Apple Software, provided that you ensure that all such users understand and comply with the terms of this License. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Apple that replace and/or supplement the original Apple Software product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.

D. You may not, and you agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the Apple Software or any services provided by the Apple Software, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Apple Software). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Apple and its licensors of the Apple Software.

E. You agree to use the Apple Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you download or use the Apple Software and Services.

### 3. Transfer.

If you obtained the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware, you may make a one-time permanent transfer of all your license rights to the Apple Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Apple Software, including all its component parts, original media, printed materials, and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Apple Software reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this License.

C. Copies of Apple Software that are provided by Apple as part of a maintenance, replacement, or software update program may only be transferred if the entire Apple Software is transferred as part of the same transaction, and only if the transfer includes all its component parts, original media, printed materials, and this License. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Apple Software.

### 4. Consent to Use of Data.
A. Diagnostic and Usage Data. If you opt in to diagnostic and usage collection, you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process, and use diagnostic, technical, usage, and related information, including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to provide and improve Apple’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Apple Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### 8. Limitation of Liability.
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OR ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above-stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
